A C++ utility library that's really just written for learning and saving time for myself as I don't need to rewrite common utility stuff in other projects

ulib.hpp includes all standard libraries needed, but if you don't want everything ulib offers you can include separate headers but include the libraries they need yourself. The libraries needed are documented in respective file.
